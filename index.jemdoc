I am an Assistant Professor of the [https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering ] at [https://www.purdue.edu/ Purdue University], where I lead the [group.html Learning Systems Group]. Previously, I was an NSF Computing Innovation Fellow and Postdoctoral Associate at [https://www.csail.mit.edu/ MIT CSAIL] mentored by [https://people.csail.mit.edu/mcarbin/ Michael Carbin]. During my postdoc, I also held an visiting position at [https://www.metacareers.com/life/facebook-infrastructure-inside-data-center-strategy-and-development/ Meta Infra Data Center] to improve maintenance efficiency of millions of servers in real-world hyperscale datacenters. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [http://www.cs.uchicago.edu The University of Chicago] advised by [http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~hankhoffmann/ Henry Hoffmann].

My research interests are in the broad areas of *computer systems, computer architecture, and machine learning*, with a recent focus on *sustainable cloud computing, and causal inference for distributed systems*.

== What is New? 
*PhD hiring (2024 - 2025)*: I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D students who are devoted to research excellence or high-quality system building in *energy-efficient datacenters, sustainable cloud computing, and learning-based techniques for computer systems optimization*. If you are interested in working with me, please apply for [https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/Academics/Graduates/phd Purdue ECE PhD program] and mention my name in your application. 

*To students at Purdue*: There are research opportunities on the intersection between computer systems and machine learning in my group, through independent studies (undergrad, MS and PhD) and thesis options (MS and PhD). If you are interested, I would recommend you to have a quick look at my active research and recent publications first before contacting me. To match the email filter, please include the magic word xyzzyx257 somewhere in your email body (not title). Otherwise, your email will not be read.
